class CriticalBand(NamedTuple):
    """
    The ``max_level`` leaves ``det A`` changes sign across, with ``det A`` at their samples.

    A leaf is in the band when :func:`in_band` holds for the determinants at
    its six samples -- the three vertices and the three edge midpoints, the
    corners of its four red-split children.

    Samples are deduplicated by lattice key: a sample shared by several band
    leaves is one row, with one ``det``, so every leaf sharing it agrees on
    its class. That consistency is what lets
    :func:`~caustics.lenses.func.adaptive.curves.critical_curves_and_caustics`
    chain the crossings of neighbouring leaves.

    Parameters
    ----------
    leaves: ArrayLike
        Shape ``(F,)`` int64 index into ``LensMesh.origin_leaves``.
    samples: ArrayLike
        Shape ``(F, 6)`` int64 index into ``lens``, ``source`` and ``det``:
        each leaf's ``theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, m_1, m_2, m_3``, the vertices
        in the leaf's own order and ``m_i`` opposite ``theta_i``.
        Samples are numbered in ascending lattice-key order.
    lens: ArrayLike
        Shape ``(S, 2)`` float64 lens-plane position of each sample.

        *Unit: arcsec*
    source: ArrayLike
        Shape ``(S, 2)`` float64 source-plane image of each sample.

        *Unit: arcsec*
    det: ArrayLike
        Shape ``(S,)`` float64 ``det A`` at each sample.
