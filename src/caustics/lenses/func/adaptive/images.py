    One representative per cluster of near-coincident points, within each block.

    Clusters are the connected components of the ``distance < tol`` graph,

    represented by its point of smallest residual, ties going to the
    earliest: the earliest root of an image can be the least converged one.
    Blocks are grouped by
    size, and blocks of zero or one point skip the clustering. Block-major
    order is restored by gathering with the inverse permutation -- the
    ``argsort`` of the groups' rows -- since torch and jax resolve a scatter

):
    """
    Lens-plane positions of every image of each source-plane point.

    Each leaf with a finite raytrace and Jacobian whose source-plane
    triangle contains the point, or, for a leaf that did not converge,
    reaches it (:func:`mesh_query`), seeds Levenberg-Marquardt
    (:func:`~caustics.utils.batch_lm`) with the preimage under the leaf's
    affine map. A root is kept when it maps to within ``residual_tol`` of
    the point and lies in its seed's leaf or within ``max(r, min_img_sep)``
    of the seed, ``r`` the leaf's :func:`~.criterion.affine_error`
    (:func:`near_seed`), and lies in the fov: near a fold, a small residual
    alone admits points far from any image. Kept roots closer than
    ``min_img_sep`` are one image, the one of smallest residual.

    On a leaf that did not converge, ``r`` can be far larger than
    ``min_img_sep`` (near a fold it is unbounded), so the residual test is
    then the only filter. Near a critical curve, a stalled solve can leave a
    point within ``residual_tol`` of the source that is not an image, at a
    very large magnification.

    Every image lies in the fov only on a mesh whose fov cuts no critical
    curve (see :func:`~.lens_mesh.build_closed_lens_mesh`); elsewhere an
    image outside the fov is lost silently.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bx, by: ArrayLike
        Source-plane points, any shape, flattened to ``(B,)``.

        *Unit: arcsec*
    raytrace: Callable[[ArrayLike, ArrayLike], Tuple[ArrayLike, ArrayLike]]
        The raytrace ``mesh`` was built from.
    mesh: LensMesh
    batch_size: Optional[int]
        Most source points per chunk, bounding memory. Image counts do not
        depend on it; positions can move within solver accuracy.
    residual_tol: float
        Largest ``|raytrace(x) - beta|`` of a kept root. It must exceed the
        residual the raytrace can reach: one computed in float32 resolves
        only about ``1e-7 * |x|``, coarser than ``1e-6`` beyond about 10
        arcsec.

        *Unit: arcsec*
    lm_kwargs: Optional[dict]
        Extra keyword arguments for :func:`~caustics.utils.batch_lm`,
        overriding the defaults ``jit=True`` and ``stopping=1e-10``. Its own
        ``stopping``, ``1e-4``, ends a solve with roots that can miss
        ``1e-6``, even well conditioned ones.

    Returns
    -------
    x, y: ArrayLike
        ``(K,)`` image positions, source by source: the ``counts[b]`` images
        of source ``b`` follow those of sources ``0 .. b - 1``.

        *Unit: arcsec*
    counts: ArrayLike
        ``(B,)`` int64 images per source.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

        (:func:`~.lens_mesh.inside_fov_image`), a NaN source included. Where
        the lens is non-finite on the fov boundary, the boundary's image has
