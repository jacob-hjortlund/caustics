"""
The backend the mesh bookkeeping runs on, and conversions to and from the user's.

The bookkeeping is gathers, sorts and searches on arrays whose sizes depend
on the data. Torch runs them as they come; eager jax compiles each anew for
nearly every call, so under jax the bookkeeping runs on torch on the CPU.
Lens calls and root finding stay in the user's backend, and the public
functions convert at their boundary (:func:`to_mesh`, :func:`to_user`).
Under torch ``mesh_backend`` is ``backend`` itself and nothing converts.
